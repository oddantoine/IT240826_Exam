There might be multiple issues at work here. You might've activated the Show Formulas option in the formulas tab on the ribbon. 
The easy fix for that problem is to go to the aforementioned formulas tab in the ribbon and if it's highlighted click on it to deactivate it.
If that isn't the problem you have, it might be because Excel thinks your formula is text which could be fixed in different ways.

Firstly, let's check for an error in the formula. Make sure there is no space before the equals sign of the formula or an apostrophe.
If that's not the problem then make sure the cell format is not in the text format.
If it is, change it to your preferred format and that should fix all your problems.
